# Digital Pali Reader

The Digital Pali Reader (DPR) is a tool much like a hard-copy language reader, facilitating study of the Pali language at an advanced level. Rather than offering a translation for the text being read, a reader usually includes a dictionary with all of the difficult words found in the reader.

The original DRP was written by [Yuttadhammo Bikkhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuttadhammo_Bhikkhu) as a Firefox plugin. As per his wishes this project is a rewrite of the original tool as a SPA using modern frontend stack.

More details on DPR can be found at its [original home](https://pali.sirimangalo.org/).

Source code for the original DPR can be found [here](https://github.com/yuttadhammo/digitalpalireader).
